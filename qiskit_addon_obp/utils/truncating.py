    """Calculate the budget available to each slice for observable term truncation.

    This method makes the construction of a :class:`.TruncationErrorBudget` easier for an end-user.
    This error budget can be provided to the :meth:`~qiskit_addon_obp.backpropagate` method to
    enable the truncation of low-weight Pauli terms. Refer to the `how-to guide
    <../how_tos/truncate_operator_terms.html>`__ for a detailed discussion on truncating terms from
    the output operator and bounding the incurred error.

    The construction logic is as follows:
        - if ``max_error_per_slice`` is provided its value is converted to a list and used immediately
          for :attr:`.TruncationErrorBudget.per_slice_budget`
        - if the above is not the case, ``max_error_total`` has to be set
        - if ``num_slices`` is **not** set,:attr:`.TruncationErrorBudget.per_slice_budget` gets set to
          ``[max_error_total]`` resulting in the entire budget being consumed **greedily**
        - however, if ``num_slices`` is provided, then :attr:`.TruncationErrorBudget.per_slice_budget`
          assumes an even distribution of the maximum total error across the specified number of
          slices: ``[max_error_total / num_slices]``

    Finally, if ``max_error_total`` is set, this puts a hard limit on the total maximum error to be
    accumulated throughout the entire backpropagation. Thus, setting ``max_error_per_slice`` and
    ``max_error_total`` can be of value.

    .. note::

       Budget not spent during a previous iteration will carry over into subsequent iterations,
       meaning that the maximum budget for any slice during backpropagation may in fact exceed
       :attr:`.TruncationErrorBudget.per_slice_budget`.

    Args:
        max_error_per_slice: Specifies the maximum error per backpropagated slice. See above for
            more details.
        max_error_total: Specifies the total maximum error for the entire backpropagation. See
            above for more details.
        num_slices: The number of slices over which to distribute the budget. See above for more details.
        p_norm: The Lp norm of the error. This affects the gradual distribution of
            ``max_error_total`` in the case of ``num_slices`` also being set (see above). Refer to the
            `how-to guide <../how_tos/bound_error_using_p_norm.html>`__ for a detailed conversation
            on bounding truncation error using higher Lp-norms.
