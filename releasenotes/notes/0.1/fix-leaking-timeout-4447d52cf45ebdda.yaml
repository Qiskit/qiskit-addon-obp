    When the ``max_seconds`` argument to the :func:`~qiskit_addon_obp.backpropagate` method
    is used, but the timeout is not reached during the actual OBP execution, the
    signal will now be reset properly, thereby avoiding cancellations at a
    (seemingly) random later point in time (of course, it is not random but
    actually after the specified amount of time has passed, but the rest of the
    code being executed after OBP could be doing anything at this point).
