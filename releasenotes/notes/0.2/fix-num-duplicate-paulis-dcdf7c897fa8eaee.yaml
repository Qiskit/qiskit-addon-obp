    The :attr:`~.SimplifyMetadata.num_duplicate_paulis` was previously unable to
    differentiate from Pauli terms that were trimmed due to their coefficient
    being close to zero. This is now tracked correctly with these trimmed terms
    only counting towards :attr:`~.SimplifyMetadata.num_trimmed_paulis`.
