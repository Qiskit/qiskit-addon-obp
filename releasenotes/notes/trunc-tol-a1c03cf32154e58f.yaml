    :func:`~.truncate_binary_search` now accepts a ``tol`` kwarg. Once an optimal truncation threshold, up to this value, has been found, the search for an optimal threshold will stop.

    :class:`~.TruncationErrorBudget` now holds a ``tol`` field. This field is used by :func:`~.backpropagate` as the ``tol`` argument to :func:`~.truncate_binary_search`.
